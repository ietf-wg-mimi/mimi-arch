--- abstract

The More Instant Messaging Interoperability (MIMI) working group is defining a
suite of protocols that allow messaging providers to interoperate with one
another.  This document lays out an overall architecture enumerating the MIMI
protocols and how they work together to enable an overall messaging experience.

# Introduction

Today, there are many providers of messaging functionality.  A provider
typically provides the client software (e.g., a mobile app) and the servers that
facilitate communications among clients.  The core function of MIMI is enabling
users to have messaging interactions across message providers.

This overall goal breaks down into several sub-goals:

* Message formats that enable the user-level features of a messaging system
* Tracking of state across multiple providers
* End-to-end security of user messages
* Transport of protocol messages among providers

In this document, we describe the high-level functions of these protocols, and
how they work toegether to enable an overall messaging application.

# Conventions and Definitions

{::boilerplate bcp14-tagged}

The following terms are used by this document and the MIMI working group for a
shared understanding of the overall system:

_Messaging Provider_ or _Provider_: A service offering instant messaging to
users. Each provider has a logical server to route events between users (or
clients, more specifically).

_User_: A (normally) human operator of a client. Users have a distinct _User ID_
to canonically identify them.

_Client_: A user interface for messaging, performing encryption as needed. Presents
chats to the user to interact with. Synonymous with _MLS Client_. Clients have
a _Client ID_ to canonically represent them among the user's other clients. Clients
MAY also be called _Devices_ to differentiate them from a named application.

_Server_: A logical location operated by a messaging provider which ensures
message and information delivery. A server may be realized by multiple physical
computers. Servers own users which belong to them. Servers are considered to be
"participating" in a room if they have at least one joined user participant.

_Hub_: The specific server in a room with operational responsibility for delivery
between all servers in the room. This includes messages and, where applicable,
information about the room or underlying cryptographic state.

_Follower_: All non-hub servers in a room. Followers are required to interact
with the hub server to send messages, and are responsible for "last mile" delivery
of a message to its local users.

_Room_: The virtual space where users communicate. This is semantically different
from an _MLS Group_: an MLS Group is responsible for handling client keys while
a room is simply the user-facing construct for communications. Rooms have a
cryptographic state component as well. MLS uses a Group to represent that state.
Rooms have a _Room ID_ to canonically identify them. Rooms may additionally be
called _Chats_, _Conversations_, or _Channels_.

_State_: The room's user participation information, cryptographic state, and other
metadata as required, collectively.

_User Participation_: The set of users which can engage in conversation within a
given room, or could engage if they complete further actions. For example, users
may be "invited" to converse, and can accept (join) or reject (leave). Users are
not considered to have "membership". Instead, users are _participants_ in the
room. A list of these users is called the _Participant List_.

_Client Membership_: The set of clients belonging to participating users within
a given room's cryptographic state. Clients are not considered to have
"participation". Instead, clients are _members_ of the room. A list of these
clients is called the _Membership_ for a room.

_Active Participant_: A participating user with at least one client member in the
room's cryptographic state.

_Inactive Participant_: A participating user with zero client members in the room's
cryptographic state. Users in this state may be unable to decrypt messages sent
while no clients are members.

_Add_ (Operation): Places a client or user into a joined state, able to converse
with other clients/users also in the joined state. When adding a user, all of
their clients are implicitly added as well.

_Remove_ (Operation): Kicks a client or user from a room, preventing further
conversation being received from that entity, and preventing that entity from
seeing future conversation. When a user is removed, all of their clients are
explicitly removed as well. Removal may be voluntary or non-voluntary.

_Policy_: The authorization structure within a room. Policy governs whether an
action is possible, such as whether User A can add User B to the room. Policies
are changed over time by users and servers.

_Policy Envelope_: Set by the hub server during room creation, the set of policies
which can be changed in the room.

_Event_: A structure used by servers to relay changes to the room and messages
from clients.

_State Event_: An event which mutates the _state_ of the room. These may partially
be visible to the servers of the room for authentication and authorization.

_Message Event_: An event containing a message from a client. Contents are not
visible to servers in the room.

# Overall Scope

{{overview}} shows the critical entities in the overall MIMI system and their
interactions.  Each human _user_ is represented in the system by one or more
_clients_, where each client is a specific software or hardware system belonging
to a single user.  Each provider is represented by a _server_ (logically a
single server, but possibly realized by multiple physical devices).

Messaging interactions are organized around _rooms_.  All messaging interactions
take place in the context of a room.  (Some non-messaging interactions may take
place outside of a room, such as operations to fetch information required to set
up a room.)  Rooms have a notion of
_user participation_ as well as _client membership_, both tracked as lists.
Rooms additionally have policies about things like how the room may be joined
and what capabilities each member/participant has.

The protocol interactions that drive a room unfold among the servers whose users
are participants in the room.  There is exactly one _hub_ server for the room, which
is in primary control of the room.  All other servers are known as _followers_.
Follower servers interact directly with the hub server.  Interactions between
clients occur indirectly, via the servers for the clients' providers.

# Room State

A room represnts a messaging interaction among a specific set of clients, with a
single _state_.  A major goal of the MIMI protocols is to syncrhonize the state
of a room across all of the servers and clients participating in the room.
Changes to the room's state can be proposed by either clients or servers, though
as dicussed in {{policy}}, one important aspect of the room's state is an
authorization policy that determines which actors are allowed to make which
changes.

The creation of a room is a local operation on the hub server, and thus outside
the scope of MIMI.  The hub server establishes the initial state of the room.

The state of the room includes a few types of information, most importantly:

* The end-to-end security state of the room
* The user-level participation state of the room
* The authorization policy for the room

{: #fig-room-state title="Elements of the Room State" }

## End-to-End Security State

Messages sent within a room are protected by an end-to-end security protocol to
ensure that the servers handling messages cannot inspect or tamper with
messages.  This means that the required cryptographic keys need to be
provisioned to any client from which a user can interact with the room.  The
state of this end-to-end security protocol thus represents the precise set of
clients that can send and receive messages in the room, the most precise notion
of membership for a room.  A client that has the required keys for end-to-end
security is said to be a member of the end-to-end security state of the room.

The end-to-end security state of a room has public and private aspects.  Servers
may store the public aspects of the end-to-end security state, such as
identities and credentials presented by the clients in the room.  The private
aspects of the group, such as the symmetric encryption keys, are known only to
the clients.

## Participants and Members

The _participant list_ for a room is the set of users who are allowed to interact
with the room in some way.  The specific list of ways in which a user may
participate is defined by authorization policy, as discussed in {{policy}}.

Note the parallel terminology with regard to inclusion of clients or users in
the room:

* A *client* is a *member* of the *end-to-end security state* of the room
* A *user* is a *participant* in the room

The user-level _participant list_ and the client-level _membership_ of the room
are distinct entities managed by separate protocols, but they must be consistent
with each other.  A client may be a member of the E2EE state of a room only if
its user is a participant in the room.  However, a user may be a participant in
a room without any client belonging to the user being part of the end-to-end
security state of the room.  (Such a user will not be able to read or send
messages, but may be able to take other actions.  It is up to client
implementations how this state is represented.)

A user with at least one client joined to the end-to-end security state of the
room is known as an _active user_, since such a user can fully participate in
the room.

## Membership Changes

The participant list and client membership of a group can change over time, via _add_ and _remove_
operations at both the user level and the client level.  These operations are
independent at the protocol level: For example, a user may be added to a room
before any of its clients are available to join, or a user may begin using a new
device (adding the device without changing the user-level participation).

As discussed above, user-level participation and client-level membership must be kept in sync.
When a user is added, some set of their clients should be added as well; when a
user leaves or is evicted, any clients joined to the room should be removed.
The cryptographic constraints of end-to-end security protocols mean that servers
cannot perform this synchronization; it is up to clients to keep these two types
of state in sync.

## Policy

Each room has an associated _policy_ that governs which protocol actions are
authorized for the room while the policy is in effect.  The policy defines
several aspects of the room's behavior, for example:

* Admission policy: Do new members need to be explicitly added by a current
  member of the room, or can some set of users join unilaterally?
* Capabilities per user: Is a given user allowed to ...
    * Send messages in the room?
    * Add or remove other users?
    * Grant or deny capabilities to other users?
* Capabilities per server: Is a given server participating in the room allowed
  to...
    * Add or remove users?
    * Grant or deny capabilities to users?

The hub server for a room defines the _policy envelope_ for the room, the set of
of acceptable policies for the room.  The hub also sets the initial policy for
the room when it is created.  Pursuant to that initial policy, the clients and
servers participating in the room may then make further changes to the policy.

At any given time, all of the clients and servers have the same view of the
room's policy.  A client or server that receives an event that is not compliant
with the room's policy may thus safely discard it, since all of the other
participating clients/servers should also reject the event.

# Protocol Interactions

As shown in {{fig-protocols}}, MIMI protocols define server-to-server interactions and
client-to-client interactions.  Each client interacts with the overall system by
means of its provider's server (whether hub or follower).  Client-to-client
interactions are done by means of these servers.

The messages sent within a room are forwarded among participating clients by
servers.  However, messages are protected by an end-to-end security protocol so
that their content is only accessible to the clients participating in the room.

In addition to forwarding messages, servers participate in control protocols
that coordinate the state of the room across the participating providers.  Both
message forwarding and control protocols leverage a common framework for sharing
_events_ among servers.  Events are protected with the same end-to-end security
protocol as clients' messages, so that the actors updating a room are
authenticated and the clients participating in a room can confirm that they
agree on the state of the room.

Note that some parts of the overall system are explicitly out of scope for MIMI.
Namely, client-server interactions internal to a provider (indicated by
"(Provider)" in {{fig-protocols}}) can be arranged however the provider likes.

The MIMI protocol implemented by servers thus incorporates a few sub-protocols:

* A transport protocol for sending room events among servers
* A state synchronization protocol for coordinating updates to the room state
* A message forwarding protocol

A common end-to-end security layer provide common security services to all of
these functions.

## End-to-End Security

As noted above, all of the clients participating in a room are part of the same
end-to-end security context.  This allows them to protect their messages so that
they are secure from inspection or tampering as they transit MIMI servers.

In addition to the message protection noted above, the end-to-end security layer
of the protocol provides a few additional functions to the remainder of the
protocol:

* Authentication of the actors making changes to a room
* Confirmation that the clients in a room agree on the state of the room

The authentication function allows MIMI servers to verify the identity of a
client making a change to the room, as an input to a policy evaluation to check
whether the change is authorized.  MIMI servers can make changes to a room,
within the bounds of the room's authorization policy.  Thus, MIMI servers also
need to be represented in the end-to-end security state of the room, but as
actors who can only authenticate, and are not given access to confidential
end-to-end security state.  In MLS terms, they are added as external senders,
not as members of the group.

The MIMI protocol includes end-to-end security components to keep the end-to-end
security state of the room aligned with the room's participant list, and to
ensure that all clients participating in the room have the proper configuration
(e.g., trusting the appropriate set of servers).

## Events and Transport

A room's activities are realized by servers exchanging _events_.  Events come in
two types:

* **State events**, which make changes to the room state
* **Message events**, which describe actual messaging activity in the room

Each event originates at one of the servers participating in the room (possibly
as a result of some interaction with a client).  The originating server sends
the event to the hub server for the room, who distributes it to the other follower
servers.

Each event is authenticated by its originating server so that all other
participating servers can verify its origin, even those to whom the event has
been distributed by the hub.  If an event was ultimately created by a client, it
is also authenticated by the client that created it.

The overall MIMI protocol defines this event framework, including its
authentication scheme, as well as the mechanics of how events are delivered from
one server to another.

## Room State Synchronization

The servers involved in a room use an application state synchronization protocol
to coordinate changes to a room's state, particularly those listed in
{{room-state}}.  A few types of room state are synchronized, in what can be
viewed as independent control sub-protocols:

A **policy control protocol** distributes information about the policy
envelope of a room, and allows participants in a room to propose changes to the
policy within that envelope.

A **participation control protocol** manages the user-level membership of the
room, including the various ways that members might join or leave a room (or be
added/removed by other users).

As discussed above, the **end-to-end security control protocol** manages the
end-to-end security state of the room.  This protocol also allows servers to
distribute cryptographic information that clients have pre-registered, which
allows clients to be asynchronously added to rooms.

## Messages

Mesage events are end-to-end secure objects that carry application messages in
the standard MIMI content format.  The end-to-end encapsuation ensures that the
message content is only accessible to the clients participating in the room, not
the servers that help to distribute it.

The MIMI message format {{?I-D.ietf-mimi-content}} defines how clients achieve
the various features of a messaging application, for example:

* Text messaging
* File attachements
* Replies
* Reactions
* Initiation of real-time sessions

Messages transit MIMI servers by means of a **message forwarding protocol**,
which carries an opaque, encrypted message payload together with enough metadata
to facilitate delivery to the clients participating in a room.

{: #fig-fanout title="The hub fans out messages to participating servers;
servers deliver messages to users' clients." }

When a client sends a message, the message is delivered to its provider's server
using some provider-internal mechanism.  If the provider is not the hub, then
the server forwards the message to the hub for delivery.  In either case, the
hub distributes the message to all of the servers participating in the room.
Each provider's server then forwards the message to clients of users who are
participating in the room.

# Actors, Identifiers, and Authentication

There are several types of entity to be identified in the MIMI system, including:

* Rooms,
* Servers,
* Users, and
* Clients.

A server's identity is effectively the identity of the provider it represents.
A room is hosted by a single hub server at a given time, so its identity is
within the scope of the hub server's identity.

To facilitate the application of policies based on these identifiers to protocol
actions, each actor presents one or more credentials that associate a signature
key pair to their identifiers.  Protocol messages are then signed by their
senders to authenticate the origin of the message.

For a deeper discussion of identity, see {{?I-D.mahy-mimi-identity}}.

# Minimal Metadata Mode

In MIMI's regular mode of operation, the identity of room participants is
visible to the room's Hub. For cases where this is not desirable, MIMI supports
a Minimal Metadata mode, where per-group pseudonyms take the place of user- and
client identities on the Hub. While this limits the visibility of the Hub into
group membership, group members can still determine one-another's identities.

Identities are protected from the hub through the use of pseudonymous credential
and encryption of (non-pseudonymous) client credentials on the level of MLS. A
key management layer on top of MLS to manages the encryption keys and ensures
that members are always able to learn the identity of all participants by
decrypting the client credentials.

The key management layer requires that users perform a connection establishment
protocol with any user they want to add to a room via the add operation. In
addition, new room participants (or clients of existing participants) entering
the room through a join operation need to first learn the necessary key material
to de-pseudonymize existing participants, for example through a join link
provided by a participant.

TODO: Add more details on connection establishment once it's better defined.


# Security Considerations

TODO

* Authorization policy attached to a room
* E2E security for messages provided by message delivery protocol
* E2E/E2M/M2E/M2M security for events provided by transport protocol
* HbH security provided by TLS


# IANA Considerations

This document has no IANA actions.
